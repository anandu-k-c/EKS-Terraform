## Project: EKS Cluster with VPC on AWS using Terraform

**Objective**: This project demonstrates how to create a scalable and secure Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS using Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.

Technologies Used:

	•	Terraform: For automating infrastructure provisioning.
 
	•	Amazon EKS: For deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters.
 
	•	AWS VPC: For setting up a network environment with subnets, route tables, and gateways.
 
	•	IAM Roles and Policies: For managing permissions and security in AWS.
 
	•	Amazon EC2: For EKS worker nodes.
